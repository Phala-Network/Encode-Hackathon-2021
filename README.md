# Phala x Polkadot Encode Club Hackathon

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*jGlQlTIwoDBLYmN83Kzrzw.jpeg)

On this page, you will find everything you need to participant in the Phala challenges in the Polkadot Hack event.

This hackathon is part of Encode Club's long-term Polkadot program, funded by the Polkadot on-chain treasury, and supported by ecosystem projects including Phala Network.

Phala Network is a Polakdot ecosystem project focusing on trustless cloud computing, based on secure enclave technology. Unlike conventional smart contracts, Phala smart contracts can:

- **be privacy-preserving**: you can store secret data like private keys, API keys, or privacy data in a contract
- **interact with HTTP services**: you can build an oracles or telegram bots as a smart contract
- **run computation extensive code**: you can build games and analytics jobs in smart contracts without block latency.

To learn more about what you can build on Phala, please read the challenge ideas, refer to our [documentation](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/developer/).

## üèÅ Phala Challenges

### Beginners

Follow the ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù tutorials to complete two challenges. You can get $25 prize for each finished challenge. The first 50 successful submissions are eligible for the prize.

| Challenge 1 | Challenge 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| $25    | $25    |

**Challenge 1**: In the beginner challenges, we have prepared the tutorials to start a local Phala Network testnet, and run two simple demo DApps.

**Challenge 2**: Hack on one of the DApps. You can add a tiny new feature and showcase it on the demo frontend.

For the challenge details and how to submit, please refer to:

- [Beginner Challenge 1 sub-page](beginner-challenge-1.md)
- [Beginner Challenge 2 sub-page](beginner-challenge-2.md)


### Advanced

Build a fully functional DApp on Phala Confidential Cloud.

We don't limit the scope or type of the DApp. When the hackathon is finished, the Phala team will judge the submission and pick up the winners of prizes:

| 1st | 2nd | 3rd | plus |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| $3000    | $2000    | $1000    | $500 for each qualified submission |

A qualified DApp should be _useful_ to solve some real-world problems or bring fun to people. It should also address the unique features of Phala (privacy-preserving, computation-intensive, or with HTTP requests)

For the challenge details and how to submit, please refer to:

- [Advanced Challenge sub-page](advanced-challenge.md)

### **In addition, documentation and tutorial contributions are elegible for our [Code Bounty Program](https://github.com/Phala-Network/bounty-program).**

# Phala x Polkadot Hack

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*jGlQlTIwoDBLYmN83Kzrzw.jpeg)

This hackathon is part of Encode Club's long-term Polkadot program, funded by the Polkadot on-chain treasury, and supported by ecosystem projects including Phala Network.

Phala Network is a Polakdot ecosystem project focusing on trustless cloud computing, based on secure enclave technology. Unlike conventional smart contracts, Phala smart contracts can:

- **be privacy-preserving**: you can store secret data like private keys, API keys, or privacy data in a contract
- **interact with HTTP services**: you can build an oracles or telegram bots as a smart contract
- **run computation extensive code**: you can build games and analytics jobs in smart contracts without block latency.

To learn more about what you can build on Phala, please read the challenge ideas, refer to our [documentation](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/developer/).

2. Submit a brief introduction to the usage of your DApp
3. Take a screenshot of your frontend to show your unique feature
4. Send the screenshots and share your feeling on Twitter
5. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zQKNGv4) and submit the link to your tweet in the **#polkadot-hack-submission** chat room.
